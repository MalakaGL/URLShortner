# URLShortener
A simple URL shortener

This sample URL shortener is created using Spring Framework.

I have used spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf and
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa in Spring framework.

To temporary store data I have used in-memory database hsqldb.

To do some styling I have used BootStrap.

To run this project and see how it works simply pull the source code and
run below commands inside source root.

``
mvn clean package
java -jar .\target\ShortURL-1.0.000.jar
``
